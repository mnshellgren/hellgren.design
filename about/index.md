  I consider myself a generalist as i'm equally comfortable with UX design and development. UX is the core of the work I do, but i find it not only intriguing to work closely to development, but also useful and fun. On more occasions than i can count, my skills in web development has either sped up problem solving or stregthened communication.

  I'm currently a consultant at Cartina, where i help clients implement user-friendly experiences while also aiming for improved UX maturity from the bottom up.

  On the side i enjoy the outdoors in different ways, mostly trail running, climbing or skiing. More often than not I also bring my camera with me.
